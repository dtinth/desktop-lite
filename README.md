# xtigervnc-docker

A standalone X11+VNC container for development in Docker based on [TigerVNC](https://tigervnc.org/).

TigerVNCâ€™s [Xvnc](https://tigervnc.org/doc/Xvnc.html) provides both X11 and VNC servers in one, which [offers a better performance][whytiger] compared to running Xvfb and a VNC server separately. This lets you run GUI applications inside Docker without having to include an X server in the application image. For an example usage, see my note [Running an X11 display server and noVNC on Codespaces](https://notes.dt.in.th/CodespacesDisplayServer).

[Pre-built images are available on GitHub Packages](https://github.com/dtinth/xtigervnc-docker/pkgs/container/xtigervnc-docker), [built by GitHub Actions](https://github.com/dtinth/xtigervnc-docker/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml).

## Ports

- `:6000` - X11 server
- `:5900` - VNC server

## Environment Variables

- `VNC_GEOMETRY` - Set to `<width>x<height>` of the desktop. Default 1280x800.
- `OPENBOX_ENABLED` - Default is `1`. Set to `0` to disable [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page) window manager. If disabled, windows will not have a title bar and will not be resizable. Do this if you plan to bring your own window manager.
